# Code Challenge for Circle

# Approach
I wanted to try a couple of different things with this challenge:
1. Use only vanilla JavaScript
2. Use flexbox to handle most of the responsiveness
3. Reduce specifity

A slightly more in-depth explanation of my reasoning
1. I wanted to limit myself to vanilla JS because I am already comfortable with
my proficiency in jQuery
2. I have only used flexbox a couple of times but I figured it would eliminate
so this was a good opportunity for me to dig deep into it, have a responsive grid
and not rely on BootStrap
3. I know for large scale websites relying on overuse of class names can cause
issues so I tried to avoid that.
